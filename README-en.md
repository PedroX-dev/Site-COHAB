## 📋 About the Project

The new COHAB Minas website is a web application developed with a strong focus on organization, accessibility, and usability.  
The homepage acts as a central dashboard, providing quick access to the system’s main functionalities through a clean, modern, and responsive design.

This project was developed as part of a practical implementation in the real COHAB working environment, demonstrating skills in Front-End, Back-End, UI/UX, and structural best practices.

As this is a recent project, improvements will be continuously updated on GitHub.  
Below is a video showcasing the current system functionality:
